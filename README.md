### Bluetooth Wireless Gateway using Gateworks Ventana SBC

## Overview 
Project Dependencies:
    - lbluetooth 
    - glib-2.0
    
This project is built off the btgatt server/client example provided in the bluez library developer package. The intention is to demonstrate the capabilities of the Gateworks GW16126 Bluetooth 5 expansion card by creating a bluetooth gateway linked to an Azure database.

There is a client program and a server program. The client program can send messages to the server and the server will send them to the cloud. 
The Server program runs on one board while the client runs on another. When the server is running the client can connect and setup communication. A bluetooth handle is created
